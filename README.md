# SQUID V1 setup for droplet sorting microfluidic chips 
This is the set-up and driver material for a custom SQUID / OCTOPI V1 (beta) setup that has been set-up in a custom arrangement as part of our microfluidic droplet sorting laboratory instrument. It is used for z-positioning (focus) of the detector arm objective, and for x/y positioning of the sorting chip on a 6cm movement range stage.

## Introduction
Squid (Simplifying Quantitive Imaging Development and Deployment) provides a full suite of hardware and software components for rapidly configuring high-performance microscopes tailored to users' applications with reduced cost, effort and turnaround time. Besides increasing accessibility of research microscopes and available microscope hours to labs, it is also designed to simplify development and dissemination of new or otherwise advanced microscopy techniques.
